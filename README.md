# Favourite Countries App

Built for the Integrify Fullstack Academy, this app works with the REST countries API, displays them into a large table ontowhich the user can search, view additional information about individual countries, or add them to their "favourites". Uses React, TypeScript, React Redux for state management, and Material UI for styling. Takes advantage of the useContext API for theming on the site. This project was my first time using Redux.
